# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: January 5, 2026**

This privacy policy applies to the **Noise Alert** app (hereby referred to as "Application") for Android mobile devices that was created by Noise Alert Team (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## Information Collection and Use

The Application is designed with privacy in mind. It does not require registration and does not collect personal information.

### Microphone Access

The Application uses your device's microphone to measure ambient noise levels in real-time. **Important:** Audio data is processed locally on your device and is never recorded, stored, or transmitted to any server.

### Session Data

Noise monitoring sessions (duration, min/max/average decibel levels) are stored locally on your device only. This data is never uploaded or shared.

## Crash Reporting (Firebase Crashlytics)

To improve app stability, the Application uses Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous crash reports. This includes:
- Device type and OS version
- App version
- Crash stack traces

This data is **anonymous** and cannot be used to identify you personally. You can opt out by disabling crash reporting in your device settings.

## Location Information

This Application does not collect any location information.

## Third-Party Data Sharing

Since the Application does not collect personal information, no personal data is shared with third parties. Anonymous crash data is processed by Firebase Crashlytics (Google) in accordance with [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Data Retention

- **Local session data:** Stored on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app
- **Crash reports:** Retained by Firebase for 90 days

## Opt-Out Rights

You can stop all data collection by the Application by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process on your Android device.

## Children's Privacy

The Application is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us at noisealert.dev@gmail.com so we can take appropriate action.

## Security

The Service Provider is committed to protecting your information. Since the Application processes audio locally and does not transmit personal data, there is minimal risk of unauthorized access to your information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" above. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Your Consent

By using the Application, you consent to the processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
